General
==========

There are three sides to my work as a Level Designer. The first one being own projects that I created from scratch start to finish. So far these are [Dingenskirchen](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/dingenskirchen.md), [Stiglitz](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/stiglitz.md) and [Pointe du Hoc](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md). The second aspect of my efforts are map overhauls for [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etlegacy.md), which include [Frostbite, by Moonkey](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_frostbite.md), [Bergen, by Detoeni](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_bergen.md) and [Ice](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_ice.md). The last aspect is a planned video tutorial series where I intend to create a tutorial map for new players while recording and narrating its development doubling as a video tutorial series for new Level Designers.


Own Levels
----------

I started experimenting with Level Design back in 2008 when [SplashDamage](https://www.splashdamage.com/) released the [source files](https://www.splashdamage.com/news/wolfenstein-enemy-territory-map-source-files-released/) of all six official maps. After initially moving existing prefabs from other mappers around in the editor, I started to create own buildings and structures. However, without any plans they remained experiments to familiarise myself with the level editor and the game environment. 

[**In 2010**](https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/fueldump-tunnelexit-texture-problem/129412) I started investigating the released map sources to learn from professional first hand examples. [**In 2011**](https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/pointe-du-hoc-mapping-project/130773) I then decided to apply the gained knowledge in an own project. [Pointe du Hoc](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md) was born. Partly through trial and error, partly through active support on the SplashDamage forums I constantly learned new things. That resulted in me restarting the project a grand total of 8 times until putting it aside in 2014. Over the course of 3 years working on Pointe du Hoc I learned valuable things which I then wanted to apply on a clean slate. Hence, [**2014**](https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/map-release-dingenskirchen-a-tribute/144206) marked the birth of [Dingenskirchen](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/dingenskirchen.md), the first map I managed to release together with [phisherman](https://forums.splashdamage.com/u/phisherman/summary) who created its script. [**In 2017**](https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/map-release-dingenskirchen-a-tribute/144206/89), after receiving valuable feedback regarding gameplay aspects, I was able to release a heavily improved second version. [**In 2018**](https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/map-stiglitz/233171) I participated in the annual [Trackbase map contest](https://contest.trackbase.net/) where I learned to create a map from scratch in a limited timeframe of 7 months. Creating [Stiglitz](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/stiglitz.md) was a valuable experience as it forced me to prioritise features and have a clear roadmap for development. The [**2019**](https://contest.trackbase.net/) iteration of that contest had the requirement of a `historical background`. That was the chance to revive [Pointe du Hoc](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md) which I had been carrying around for nearly 9 years by then. Applying everything I have ever learned on previous map projects, I managed to create the map start to finish from scratch within 2 months while streaming the development on [Twitch](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/twitch.md). This was possibly the biggest achievement and my proudest moment of my entire level design career. Not only was it the realisation of my very first project, it also was the start of my Twitch channel. 

Currently, a third version of Dingenskirchen is under development and scheduled to be released in the coming months and a second version of Stiglitz is planned.
