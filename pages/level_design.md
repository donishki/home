Level Design
==========

There are three sides to my work as a Level Designer. The first one being **own projects** that I created from scratch start to finish. So far these are [Dingenskirchen](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/dingenskirchen.md), [Stiglitz](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/stiglitz.md) and [Pointe du Hoc](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md). The second aspect of my efforts are **map overhauls** for [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etlegacy.md), which include [Frostbite, by Moonkey](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_frostbite.md), [Bergen, by Detoeni](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_bergen.md) and [Ice, by id software](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_ice.md). The last aspect is a planned **video tutorial series** where I intend to create a tutorial map for new players while recording and narrating its development doubling as a video tutorial series for new Level Designers.

Background

<table>
 <tr>
  <td><b>2008</b></td>
  <td>The <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/wolfenstein-enemy-territory-map-source-files-released/">source files</a> of the six official Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory maps were released by <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/">SplashDamage</a>. This marked the beginning of my journey, which initially consisted of me familiarising myself with the level editor by moving around existing prefabs from other mappers and building own structures without following plans.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>2010</b></td>
  <td>I started changing things in <a href="https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/fueldump-tunnelexit-texture-problem/129412">Fueldump</a> to see what would happen in-game. Investigating the official map sources enabled me to learn from professional examples and test in working environments.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>2011</b></td>
  <td>I then decided to apply the gained knowledge in an own project. <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md">Pointe du Hoc</a> was born and turned out to be a constant learning experience. That resulted in me restarting the project a grand total of 8 times before putting it aside in 2014.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>2014</b></td>
  <td>Over the course of the 3 years working on Pointe du Hoc I gained valuable experience which I then wanted to apply on a clean slate. Hence, 2014 marked the birth of <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/dingenskirchen.md">Dingenskirchen</a>, the first map I managed to release.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>2017</b></td>
  <td>Previously, I only received feedback to specific questions I asked, however, having an own map released meant qualitative feedback from all angles came my way. This enabled me to release a heavily improved second version of Dingenskirchen.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>2018</b></td>
  <td>I participated in the annual <a href="https://contest.trackbase.net/">Trackbase map contest</a> where I learned to create a map from scratch in a limited timeframe of 7 months. Creating <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/stiglitz.md">Stiglitz</a> was a valuable experience as it forced me to prioritise features and have a clear roadmap for development.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>2019</b></td>
  <td>The second iteration of that contest required a historical background. That was the chance to revive <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md">Pointe du Hoc</a> which I had been carrying around for nearly 9 years by then. Streaming its development on <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/twitch.md">Twitch</a> required me to have a clear roadmap, which in turn enabled me to reduce development time back to back to 2 months.</td>
