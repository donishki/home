The idtech3 engine is from a time where videogames didn't come with an amount of detail that you can see in modern games. While your computer hardware has improved substantially, the effectiveness of the engine hasn't so much. That is why even with modern computers we need to be mindful of performance when creating maps for the game.

The comparison images below are a rough outlook as to what we will cover in this tutorial part. The only difference between the two scenarios shown below is the alignment of the map with the default portals. 
In [section 1](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/tut_part1_1.md) of this tutorial we will understand why one of the scenarios is riddled with those colourful planes and why the other has a cleaner and more efficient look to it.
That knowledge we will then use to create an early layout sketch in [section 2](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/tut_part1_2.md) which will look like the grid images below. That way we are able to estimate and evaluate gameplay and performance in our map from the very start using the knowledge from section 1. 
Once happy with the layout sketch, it is then time to translate it into Radiant which will be done in [section 3](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/tut_part1_3.md). For that, we will use regular squared paper which simplifies the transition into the level editor.
