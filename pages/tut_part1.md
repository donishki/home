* collecting visual references
* layout sketch (this map does not serve as map layout tutorial -> singleplayer map)
* start with empty skybox
* show `_blocksize` grid
* VIS compile to introduce portal view plugin
* create simple structural wall with detail brushes on other side
  - #1 one completely misaligned to `_blocksize` grid
  - #2 one too short height
  - #3 one too short width
  - #4 one aligned with `_blocksize` grid
* add `hint` brushes closing the gap for #2 and #3 -> useless
* change `hint` brushes to go orthogonally -> now also sealed off

[CONTINUE HERE]
* minimalistic blockout / structural mesh
* VIS test with detail brushes
* 'show **blocksize**' option in Radiant (show how to change `_blocksize`)
* align blockout brushes to blocksize
* hint brush placement (DOs and DONTs)
* hint vs subtle hint
