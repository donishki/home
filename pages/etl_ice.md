<!-- SUMMARY -->
**Campaign: 'Rocket Base' (1/3)**
 <br>
 A small Axis coastal fortress is the target of the Allies strike group sent by OSA. Overwhelmed by the surprise attack, the Axis hastily abandoned the fortress, only to realise that confidential documents were left behind depicting supply routes to the nearby secret rocket base. Under no circumstances do the Axis intend to let the Allies get hold of the new rocket prototype. Hence, the Axis attempt to retrieve the confidential documents left behind in the coastal fortress at all costs, to transmit them to safety.

## Options
ET maps are played in very different settings depending on the active gamemode and server configuration. To avoid maintaining different variations of the same map version, the overhauls come with optional features that server admins can specify in the map script. If additional optional features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).

'Ice, by id software' currently does not provide optional features. To request a feature, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).

### Source

Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
