## Story
**Campaign: Rocket Base** 
1. **'Ice, by id software'**
2. 'Frostbite, by Moonkey'
3. 'Missile, by eiM' _(planned)_

A small Axis coastal fortress is the target of the Allies strike group sent by OSA. Overwhelmed by the surprise attack, the Axis hastily abandoned the fortress, only to realise that confidential documents were left behind depicting supply routes to the nearby secret rocket base. Under no circumstances do the Axis intend to let the Allies get hold of the new rocket prototype. Hence, the Axis attempt to retrieve the confidential documents left behind in the coastal fortress at all costs, to transmit them to safety.

## Objectives

### Axis
* Retrieve the documents.
* Capture the forward bunker.
* Destroy the main entrance.
* Destroy the side wall.
* Don't let them construct the guardtower.
* Prevent the Allies from establishing a Command Post.
* Set up a Command Post.

### Allies
* Defend the documents until reinforcements arrive.
* Capture the forward bunker.
* Do not let the Axis destroy the main entrance.
* Defend the side wall.
* Construct the guardtower.
* Establish a forward Command Post.
* Prevent the Axis from fortifying their position with a Command Post.

## Options
ET maps are played in very different settings depending on the active gamemode and server configuration. To avoid maintaining different variations of the same map version, the overhauls come with optional features that server admins can specify in the map script. If additional optional features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).

'Ice, by id software' currently does not provide optional features. To request a feature, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).


## Additions
In an attempt to aid and simplify gameplay especially for new players, a few additions have been implemented in the overhauls. If additional gameplay-aiding features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QECRUG9VAY).

### Coloured Trims
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/ice/ice_walltrim.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/ice/ice_walltrim.png"></a>
To simplify callouts for players that are not familiar with long-standing competitive terms, coloured trims have been added at the walls to allow players to quickly and easily communicate to their teammate where they or enemy players are.

### Navigational Wire
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/ice/ice_wires.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/ice/ice_wires.png"></a>
For new players the multitude of ET maps can be confusing and especially in document-run maps, time is of the essence. Therefore, wires have been added to guide the player from objective pick-up to place of delivery in a non-intrusive way.


## Changelog

## Development
 
### Source

Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
