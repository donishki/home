<!-- STORY -->
**Campaign: 'Rocket Base' (1/3)**
 <br>
 A small Axis coastal fortress is the target of the Allies strike group sent by OSA. Overwhelmed by the surprise attack, the Axis hastily abandoned the fortress, only to realise that confidential documents were left behind depicting supply routes to a nearby secret rocket base. Under no circumstances can the Axis let the Allies get hold of the new rocket prototype built in this base. Hence, the Axis attempt to retrieve the confidential documents left behind in the coastal fortress and transmit them to safety at all cost.

## Specs and Credits

### Options
 
ET maps are played in different gamemodes and configurations, occasionally calling for different settings. To avoid maintaining separate variations of the same map, optional features have been added, which can be toggled in the map script `pk3/maps/<mapname>.script`. Toggle the optional features by (un-)commenting the respective line. Upload the changed mapscript to your server's mapscript directory *(path depends on mod)*. The following optional features are included in **Ice**:
* [ ] Additional health and ammo cabinets in the southern tunnel. *(default disabled)*
* [x] Secure functionality for the Axis flag when Side Wall is destroyed. *(default enabled)*

### Source
Since we are talking about an open-source game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept up-to-date with all latest changes, which means the map source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release.

### Credits
This is not my own map. It is a visual overhaul of an existing map created by [**id software**](https://www.idsoftware.com).
<br>
They still hold all the rights to the map design and original idea and I do not claim ownership of it.
