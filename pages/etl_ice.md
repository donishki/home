Story
============

**Campaign: Rocket Base** 
1. **'Ice, by id software'**
2. 'Frostbite, by Moonkey'
3. 'Missile, by eiM' _(planned)_

Local resistance managed to leak information about a secret rocket base to the OSA headquarters. According to the intel, the Axis are developing a new rocket of devastating power. OSA headquarters organised a stealth attack to locate and gain access to said rocket base and steal the prototype. In the first mission, the Allies launch a stealth attack on an Axis coastal outpost. The Axis forces must retrieve crucial documents depicting the location of the secret rocket base which were left behind in an initial, hasty retreat to a nearby storage facility. In the second mission, the Axis fortify their position in the storage facility after successfully retrieving the documents. The Allies must infiltrate, steal the documents and radio the location of the secret Rocket Base to the OSA headquarters. In the third mission, the Axis attempt to hold the secret rocket base and prevent a loss of the weapon prototype at all cost. The Allies must find the prototype, neutralise and steal it so it can be sent to OSA headquarters for examination.

Options
============
ET maps are played in very different settings depending on the active gamemode and server configuration. To avoid maintaining different variations of the same map version, the overhauls come with optional features that server admins can specify in the map script. If additional optional features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).

'Ice, by id software' currently does not provide optional features. To request a feature, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).


Changelog
============

**NOTE:** Previous overhaul versions were too far away from the original. Version 3 is a fresh start from the original 'Ice, by id software', which is why previous versions aren't listed below.

### version 5

* Adjusted lighting and terrain blending to improve performance.
* Increased playercount from 16vs16 to 32vs32.
* Removed flag sound from guardtower.
* Fixed CP sounds playing in second round after `/map_restart`. *(Thanks to WuTangH for reporting issue on 'Supply Depot, by ginc')*
* Fixed missing command map shader on forward bunker flag for Axis.
* Fixed setstate error for non-existent entities.

### version 4

* Adjusted height of swinglights to be flush with ceiling.
* Improved overall lighting.

### version 3

* Improved VO announcements.
    – As long as both Main Entrance and Side Wall are active VO is: “defend/destroy entrances”.
    – As soon as one has been breached VO is: “defend/destroy the side OR main entrance”.
    – Added VO announcements for active map objectives when joining a team.
    – Added VO announcements for the guardtower.
* Added base alarm when the main entrance gets destroyed.
* Added colour-coded guiding system intended to ease new players into the map.
* Added ambient sounds.
* Simplified shoutcaster movement by opening the mountain range dividing the two valleys for spectators.
* Doors have been widened to allow for faster movement.
* Opened one side of the mountain to the frozen sea for narrative purposes.
* Adjusted global lighting.
* Removed snowy textures from the interior of the fortress.
* Changed castle-like theme from a short underground section to be more in line with the rest of the fortress.
* Attempted to give the duct-like connection near the flag a more realistic purpose by transforming the wall into a shelf.
* Simplified player collision near shelves, crates, etc.


Development
============
 
### Source

Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
