Story
============

In an attempt to locate a secret Rocket Base in occupied Norway, the Allies launch a stealth attack on an Axis outpost. Facing the Allied advances, the Axis quickly retreated to a nearby storage facility and abandoned the coastal fortress leaving behind crucial documents depicting the location of the secret Rocket Base. 
The Axis forces must retrieve these documents and radio them to the nearby Storage Facility for safe-keeping. 
The Allies attempt to hold the fortress until further reinforcements can make their way to the location.

Changelog
============

**NOTE:** Previous overhaul versions were too far away from the original. Version 3 is a fresh start from the original 'Ice, by id software', which is why previous versions aren't listed below.

### version 4 (pending)

* Increase max player count from 16vs16 to 20vs20 to be in line with 'Frostbite, by Moonkey'.
* Adjusted height of swinglights to be flush with ceiling.
* Fix spawnpoint order to be same as original. *(Thanks to spinnynakeyhelicopter for reporting.)*

### version 3

* Improved VO announcements.
    – As long as both Main Entrance and Side Wall are active VO is: “defend/destroy entrances”.
    – As soon as one has been breached VO is: “defend/destroy the side OR main entrance”.
    – Added VO announcements for active map objectives when joining a team.
    – Added VO announcements for the guardtower.
* Added base alarm when the main entrance gets destroyed.
* Added colour-coded guiding system intended to ease new players into the map.
* Added ambient sounds.
* Simplified shoutcaster movement by opening the mountain range dividing the two valleys for spectators.
* Doors have been widened to allow for faster movement.
* Opened one side of the mountain to the frozen sea for narrative purposes.
* Adjusted global lighting.
* Removed snowy textures from the interior of the fortress.
* Changed castle-like theme from a short underground section to be more in line with the rest of the fortress.
* Attempted to give the duct-like connection near the flag a more realistic purpose by transforming the wall into a shelf.
* Simplified player collision near shelves, crates, etc.


Development
============
 
### Source

Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
