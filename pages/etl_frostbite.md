Story
============

After successfully retrieving the curcial documents from the quickly abandoned coastal fortress, the Axis retreated to a nearby storage facility in the hinterlands of occupied Norway. In search for a secret Rocket Base reported in the area, the Allies continue their advances to said storage facility to get hold of the documents that so narrowly escaped their grasp in the coastal fortress.
The Allied forces must retrieve those documents and radio them to headquarters to decipher the location of the secret Rocket Base. 
The Axis attempt to hold the storage facility and prevent the documents falling into the wrong hands until further reinforcements can make their way to the location.

Changelog
============
**NOTE:** Previous overhaul versions were too far away from the original. Version 7 is a fresh start from the original 'Frostbite, by Moonkey', which is why previous versions aren't listed below.

* Moved vent opening neae Service Door for better alignment with surrounding textures.
* Adjusted terrain shader on snow patches in inner courtyard for proper snow behaviour.

* Adjusted terrain brushes near Storage Wall to re-enable a trickjump.
* Remove spotlight style from most light sources inside the facility.

Development

### Source

Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
