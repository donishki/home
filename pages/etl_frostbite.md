## Story
**Campaign: Rocket Base** 
1. 'Ice, by id software'
2. **'Frostbite, by Moonkey'**
3. 'Missile, by eiM' _(planned)_

Warned of the Allied plans, the Axis set up position in a fortified storage facility. With the element of surprise lost, the Allies have to launch a direct attack on this storage facility, as it is the only way to get hold of the confidential documents depicting supply routes to the nearby secret rocket base, that so narrowly escaped their grasp last time. Hence, the Allies attempt to infiltrate the facility, steal those documents and radio them to OSA headquarters for decyphering.


## Objectives

### Axis
* Stop the Allies from transmitting the Supply Documents.
* Defend the Main Door.
* Defend the Storage Wall from being breached.
* Stop the Allies from destroying the Service Door.
* Set up a Command Post inside the Transmitter Building.
* Prevent the Allies from establishing a Command Post in the Upper Complex.

### Allies
* Steal the Supply Documents and transmit them back to Allied Command.
* Destroy the Main Door into the Complex.
* Breach the Storage Wall.
* Dynamite the Service Door.
* Prevent the Axis from constructing a Command Post in the Transmitter Building.
* Establish a forward Command Post in the Upper Complex.

## Options
ET maps are played in very different settings depending on the active gamemode and server configuration. To avoid maintaining different variations of the same map version, the overhauls come with optional features that server admins can specify in the map script. If additional optional features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).
```
//====OPTIONAL SETTINGS==============================================================
wait 1000
// Toggle the line of the respective setting you want to change by (un-)commenting.
//
setstate TJ_clip invisible				// clip preventing TJ over storage wall
//===================================================================================
```
'Frostbite, by Moonkey' comes with...
* ... an optional **one-sided** clip that prevents players from jumping over the Storage Wall towards the facility, while at the same time allows players to keep jumping outwards. This clip is disabled by default. To enable it, comment the line `setstate TJ_clip invisible`.


## Additions
In an attempt to aid and simplify gameplay especially for new players, a few additions have been implemented in the overhauls. If additional gameplay-aiding features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QECRUG9VAY).

### Coloured Trims
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/frostbite/frostbite_walltrim.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/frostbite/frostbite_walltrim.png"></a>
To simplify callouts for players that are not familiar with long-standing competitive terms, coloured trims have been added at the walls to allow players to quickly and easily communicate to their teammate where they or enemy players are.

### Navigational Wire
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/frostbite/frostbite_wires.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/frostbite/frostbite_wires.png"></a>
For new players the multitude of ET maps can be confusing and especially in document-run maps, time is of the essence. Therefore, wires have been added to guide the player from objective pick-up to place of delivery in a non-intrusive way.

## Development

### Source
Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
