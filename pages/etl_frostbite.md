Story
============

**Campaign: Rocket Base** 
1. 'Ice, by id software'
2. **'Frostbite, by Moonkey'**
3. 'Missile, by eiM' _(planned)_

Local resistance managed to leak information about a secret rocket base to the OSA headquarters. According to the intel, the Axis are developing a new rocket of devastating power. OSA headquarters organised a stealth attack to locate and gain access to said rocket base and steal the prototype. In the first mission, the Allies launch a stealth attack on an Axis coastal outpost. The Axis forces must retrieve crucial documents depicting the location of the secret rocket base which were left behind in an initial, hasty retreat to a nearby storage facility. In the second mission, the Axis fortify their position in the storage facility after successfully retrieving the documents. The Allies must infiltrate, steal the documents and radio the location of the secret Rocket Base to the OSA headquarters. In the third mission, the Axis attempt to hold the secret rocket base and prevent a loss of the weapon prototype at all cost. The Allies must find the prototype, neutralise and steal it so it can be sent to OSA headquarters for examination.

Changelog

Development

### Source

Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
