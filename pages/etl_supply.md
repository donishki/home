## Story

**Campaign: Submarine Depot**

1. **‘Supply Depot, by ginc’**
2. ‘Adlernest, by Dersaidin’ *(work-in-progress)*
3. ’Bergen, by Detoeni’

The first target of the Allied paratroopers tasked with disrupting supply lines of the naval base is a smaller supply depot. According to reports by the local resistance, this depot is currently in the process of preparing a supply shipment. The Allies, therefore, launch an attack to steal this shipment and use it to further strengthen the efforts of the local resistance. The Axis cannot, under any circumstances, allow this shipment to fall into Allied hands and will attempt to defend the depot at all cost.


## Objectives

### Axis
* Stop the Allies from breaching the Forward Bunker Gate with dynamite.
* Stop the Allies from breaching the Depot Gate with dynamite.
* Ensure that the Allied truck does not reach the Depot crane.
* Stop the Allies from constructing the crane controls on the upper level of the Depot warehouse, and don't let them operate the crane.
* Do not allow the Allied truck to escape with the gold.
* Stop the Allies from breaching the West Depot Wall with dynamite.
* Stop the Allies from breaching the East Depot Wall with dynamite.
* Build a command post at the abandoned cabin, and do not allow the allies to do the same."

### Allies
* Breach the Forward Bunker Gate with dynamite.
* Breach the Depot Gate with dynamite.
* Escort the Allied truck to the Depot crane.
* Construct the crane controls on the upper level of the Depot warehouse, and operate the crane to load the gold onto the Truck.
* Escort the Allied truck out of the Depot and escape with the gold.
* Breach the West Depot Wall with dynamite.
* Breach the East Depot Wall with dynamite.
* Secondary: Build a command post at the abandoned cabin, and do not allow the axis to do the same.

## Options
ET maps are played in very different settings depending on the active gamemode and server configuration. To avoid maintaining different variations of the same map version, the overhauls come with optional features that server admins can specify in the map script. If additional optional features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QECRUG9VAY).
```
//====OPTIONAL SETTINGS==============================================================
wait 1000
// Toggle the line of the respective setting you want to change by (un-)commenting.
//
setdamagable truck 0					// Make truck invulnerable
// setstate crane_controls_TJ invisible	// Clip brush in crane controls window	(hidden by default)
// setstate radio_1_speaker invisible	// Radio in forward bunker spawn (enabled by default)
// setstate radio_2_speaker invisible	// Radio at depot gates (enabled by default)
// globalaccum 2 set 1					// Axis CP spawn (disabled by default)
// globalaccum 3 bitset 0				// Forward Spawn cabinets (disabled by default)
// globalaccum 3 bitset 1				// CP Spawn cabinets (disabled by default)
// globalaccum 3 bitset 2				// Depot Spawn cabinets (disabled by default)
//===================================================================================
```
'Supply Depot, by ginc' comes with...
* ... the option to toggle the truck (in-)vulnerable. By default, the truck is invulnerable. To let Axis damage it, comment the line `setdamagable truck 0`.
* ... an optional clip brush in the crane controls window to prevent TJ. This clip is enabled by default. To disable it, uncomment the line `setstate crane_controls_TJ invisible`.
* ... the option to disable radio speakers. They are enabled by default. To disable, uncomment the lines `setstate radio_1_speaker invisible` and `setstate radio_2_speaker invisible`.
* an optional CP spawn for the Axis team. By default, the spawn is disabled. To enable it, uncomment the line `globalaccum 2 set 1`.
* an optional health and ammo cabinet at the forward spawn flag once the Allies secured it. To enable it, uncomment the line `globalaccum 3 bitset 0`.
* an optional health and ammo cabinet at the CP once it's constructed by either team. To enable it, uncomment the line `globalaccum 3 bitset 1`.
* an optional health and ammo cabinet at the Axis depot spawn. To enable it, uncomment the line `globalaccum 3 bitset 2`.


## Additions
In an attempt to aid and simplify gameplay especially for new players, a few additions have been implemented in the overhauls. If additional gameplay-aiding features are desired, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QECRUG9VAY).

### Coloured Trims
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/supply/supply_walltrim.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/supply/supply_walltrim.png"></a>
To simplify callouts for players that are not familiar with long-standing competitive terms, coloured trims have been added at the walls to allow players to quickly and easily communicate to their teammate where they or enemy players are.

### CP Antenna
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/supply/supply_antenna.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/supply/supply_antenna.png"></a>
This addition is an antenna that is linked to the CP to provide a near-global visual indication of its status. When the CP is constructed, the antenna is fully visible, while CP is under construction the antenna indicates that by the standard construction shader and if destroyed, the antenna is not there.

### Roof Skylights
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/supply/supply_roof.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkemon/home/master/levelshots/supply/supply_roof.png"></a>
To support the movement and overview of spectators and shoutcasters, not only is the terrain opened up to allow for free movement on all overhauls, but also skylights have been added to allow spectators and shoutcasters to maintain a constant overview of crucial map areas. These skylights are solid for players and entities *(e.g. airstrikes, grenades)*, but are non-solid for spectators and shoutcasters to further strengthen free movement and allow them to drop into the action at any time.

## Development
 
### Source
Since we are talking about an open-sourced game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept updated with all latest changes, which means the map-source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release. If you encounter any issues, I would prefer it if you contacted me or simply opened an issue on the tracker, instead of recompiling a version yourself.
