The lua scripts included in this directory are not made by me. They have been kindly created by [core-C](https://github.com/core-c).
[ETmover](https://github.com/realkemon/home/tree/master/resources/luamods/etmover) is the lua script allowing free movement for escortable objectives in Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory as planned for beta 2 of [Stiglitz](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/stiglitz.md). [ETcar](https://github.com/realkemon/home/tree/master/resources/luamods/etcar) derived from that to see if it's possible.
An absolutely massive thank you to core-C for creating this fantastic implementation of the concepts and providing the opportunity to bring innovative objective types to ET maps.
