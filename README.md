*The Devil of Details*


INTRODUCTION
============

I'm a Europe-based hobby game developer in the idtech3 engine environment. For [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy), an open source project aiming to restore the good old days of [Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory](https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory), I work as a Level-Designer, 2D-Artist and Community Manager.

Level-Design
============

There are two sides to my work as a Level-Designer. The first one being own projects that I designed and created from the ground up and the second one being map-overhauls for ET:L.

### Own Levels

### Map Overhauls

**Guidelines**

As part of the visual enhancement of the game a new renderer is being developed. For it to take full effect on maps a recompile is very helpful. Because of that, several maps, which all are community favourites, have been selected and overhauled in preparation of the new renderer. These overhauls are intended as purely visual enhancements. Gameplay changes should only be implemented based on community reports about bugs or possible improvements for competitive play/map balance. For the visual overhauls a few guidelines should be kept in mind. The overall theme of the map *(e.g. winter setting)* and its atmosphere *(e.g. falling snow)* should not be altered. Generally, all changes should be as subtle as possible and emphasise on strengthening the original style rather than forcing a different style onto the map.

Basically, what should be aimed for is what CS:GO did to original CS maps. [(Reference)](https://sjackm.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/csgo-first-impressions/)
