INTRODUCTION
============

I'm a Europe-based hobby game developer in the idtech3 engine environment. For [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy), an open source project aiming to restore its good old days of [Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory](https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory), I work as a Level-Designer, 2D-Artist and Community Manager.

### Level-Design

There are two sides to my work as a Level-Designer. The first one being own projects that I designed and created from the ground up and the second one being map-overhauls for ET:L. For more information, please refer to the wiki entry. [TODO: wiki page]
