I'm Cedric a.k.a. kemon, a Europe-based Level Designer, Environment- and Texture Artist and as of late also a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/realkemon">Twitch streamer</a>. I'm part of the game development team of <a href="https://github.com/etlegacy">ET: Legacy</a>, an open source project aiming to restore the good old days of <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a>. So far my game development experience mainly revolves around to the idtech3 engine environment. However, I have also gained experience in both Unity and Unreal Engine 4 through various tutorial sessions and the Global Game Jams in <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/ggj2020">2020</a> and <a href="https://stefan.ensmann.de/en/among-silhouettes/">2019</a>.

# Level Design

## Own Maps
These are maps that I created from scratch, start to finish. I started my Level Design journey around 2008, when Splash Damage <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/wolfenstein-enemy-territory-map-source-files-released/">released</a> the source files of the 6 standard maps from Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

### Dingenskirchen

**December, 1944:**

---
*The noose tightens around the Reich's neck as Allied forces threaten to cross the Siegfried Line and invade Germany. An Eifel castle has become a central location for the Kraut High Command in this area to coordinate their troop movements. It is the last obstacle on the road into Germany and one of the final chances for the Axis to ever turn the tables. Not taking any chances, the Allies are attempting to sneak a suitcase bomb into the High Command conference room to disrupt the Axis strategy at its core.*

### Stiglitz

**July, 1943:**

---
*Local resistance reported a branch of Deathshead’s X-Labs in a small remote village. Hugo Stiglitz, an OSA agent, has been sent to infiltrate the facility and gather intel of Deathshead’s activities. Communication went dead some days ago and Stiglitz' true identity has likely been uncovered, which means almost certain death. The Allies are trying to make their way through the village, free Stiglitz and escort him back to safety for debriefing at the OSA headquarters.*

**June, 1944:**

---
*To grant safe passage for the Allied ships during D-Day a small operation is launched to disable the artillery guns of Pointe du Hoc. The Allies will attempt to gain control of the bunkers on top of the cliff and disable all Axis defense. Expecting a raid at a different section of Normandy, the Axis moved the artillery guns to a railway station in the hinterlands for transport further West. The Allies need to locate and disable those guns. The Axis have to prevent the loss of this strategic part of Normandy and the artillery guns at all costs.*

## Map Overhauls
These overhauls are primarily intended as visual enhancements. Gameplay changes should only be implemented based on community reports of bugs or possible improvements for competitive play/map balance. For the visual overhauls a few guidelines should be kept in mind. The overall theme of the map _(e.g. winter setting)_ and its atmosphere _(e.g. falling snow)_ should not be altered. Generally, all changes should be as subtle as possible and emphasise on strengthening the original style rather than forcing a different style onto the map.
Basically, what should be aimed for is what CS:GO did to original CS maps. [(Reference)](https://sjackm.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/csgo-first-impressions/)

### Campaign: Rocket Base
*Local resistance managed to leak information about the existence of a secret rocket base to the OSA headquarters. According to the intel, the Axis are developing a new rocket of devastating power, which would turn the tide in the war. OSA organised a stealth attack to gain access and steal the prototype. Unfortunately, the exact location of the rocket base remains yet unknown. Therefore, a strike group of Allied soldiers is sent to a known Axis coastal fortification in the area to gather further intel and do what is necessary to get their hands on the secret rocket prototype.*

**Mission 1:** [*'Ice, by id software'*](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_ice.md#)

---
*A small Axis coastal fortress is the target of the Allies strike group sent by OSA. Overwhelmed by the surprise attack, the Axis hastily abandoned the fortress, only to realise that confidential documents were left behind depicting supply routes to the nearby secret rocket base. Under no circumstances do the Axis intend to let the Allies get hold of the new rocket prototype. Hence, the Axis attempt to retrieve the confidential documents left behind in the coastal fortress at all costs, to transmit them to safety.*

**Mission 2:** [*'Frostbite, by Moonkey'*](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_frostbite.md#)

---
*Warned of the Allied plans to steal the new rocket prototype, the Axis set up position in a fortified storage facility. With the element of surprise lost, the Allies have to launch a direct attack on this storage facility, as it is the only way to get hold of the confidential documents depicting supply routes to the nearby secret rocket base, that so narrowly escaped their grasp last time. Hence, the Allies attempt to infiltrate the facility, steal those documents and radio them to OSA headquarters for decyphering.*

**Mission 3:** [*'Missile, by eiM'*](https://et.trackbase.net/map/158/) (planned)

---
*OSA headquarters finally managed to decypher the location of the secret rocket base that is said to house a new prototype of devastating power, according to intel from the local resistance. This weapon is rumoured to turn the tide in the war in favour of whoever holds it. Under no circumstances do the Axis intend to lose the prototype to the Allied attackers and therefore attempt to defend the rocket base. For the Allies, however, the goal is clear: Infiltrate the rocket base and steal the prototype at all cost.*

BACKUP
=======

Axis submarines from a naval base near Bergen, Norway are cause for much distress in the Northern Atlantic. After failed attempts of disabling the base from sea and air, the OSA headquarters decided to send paratroopers behind enemy lines. Their task: Disrupt the supply lines of the base and strike a then vulnerable base from land.
In the first mission, the Axis are preparing a shipment destined for the naval base from a supply depot in the mountains. The Allied paratroopers must seize those supplies for the local resistance to strengthen their efforts against the Axis forces in the region.
In the second mission, alarmed by the loss of the first supply shipment, the Axis attempt to organise retaliation. The Allies must infiltrate the Axis fortification and steal the documents depicting Axis troop movements to disrupt their retaliation attempts.
In the third mission, the Axis attempt to hold their naval base to ensure submarine operations in the Northern Atlantic. The Allies launch their attack on the weakened base and must disable communications to submarines on patrol to enforce their retreat and allow Allied convoys to reach the shores safely.




Game Development
============

> My involvement with [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy) started around 2013 when I joined the IRC channel and decided to start working on texture replication in HD to get away from the proprietary license. Since then, I have replicated the [world textures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw7Yu-pqzcSaLXEtVEVjZF82UEU) in a 2048x2048 pixel standard, visually overhauled proven community maps and am doing my best for community management as well as reaching out to potential helping hands and sister projects for possible cooperations. Future plans include continuing with map overhauls, restructuring the [wiki](https://dev.etlegacy.com/projects/etlegacy/wiki/index) to make it the first landing page for all questions revolving around ET: Legacy, familiarising myself with 3D modelling to create new playermodels and many more.

Tutorials
============

> I started creating maps for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory back in 2008 and to this day I'm still learning new things about the engine on the regular. Inactive forum boards, dead reference links and a lack of official documentations seem to dominate the current experience when looking for resources. Therefore, I decided to build a tutorial map for new players to learn the game mechanics as well as for new mappers to learn how to build said objectives and what to keep in mind when mapping for ET.
