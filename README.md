I'm Cedric a.k.a. kemon, a Europe-based Level Designer, Environment- and Texture Artist and as of late also a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/realkemon">Twitch streamer</a>. I'm part of the game development team of <a href="https://github.com/etlegacy">ET: Legacy</a>, an open source project aiming to restore the good old days of <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a>. So far my game development experience mainly revolves around to the idtech3 engine environment. However, I have also gained experience in both Unity and Unreal Engine 4 through various tutorial sessions and the Global Game Jams in <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/ggj2020">2020</a> and <a href="https://stefan.ensmann.de/en/among-silhouettes/">2019</a>.

# Level Design

## Own Maps
These are maps that I created from scratch, start to finish. I started my Level Design journey around 2008, when Splash Damage <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/wolfenstein-enemy-territory-map-source-files-released/">released</a> the source files of the 6 standard ET maps. After trying to understand their ways, 'Pointe du Hoc' was the first project that I started. This project has seen so many complete restarts that I stopped count after the 11th alpha version. After learning the very basics on this project, I needed some distance from it and started 'Dingenskirchen', which was the first map that I released. In 2018, <a href="https://et.trackbase.net/">TrackBase</a> launched a map contest for which own maps needed to be created. 'Stiglitz' was my submission for the contest in 2018. In 2019, the rules required a historical context, so the opportunity finally arose, to revisit and finish 'Pointe du Hoc'.

An Eifel castle has become a central location for the Kraut High Command in this area to coordinate their troop movements. It is the last obstacle on the road into Germany and one of the final chances for the Axis to ever turn the tables. Not taking any chances, the Allies are attempting to sneak a suitcase bomb into the High Command conference room to disrupt the Axis strategy at its core.</i> <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/dingenskirchen.md#">Read more</a></td>

Expecting a raid at a different section of Normandy, the Axis moved the artillery guns to a railway station in the hinterlands for transport further West. The Allies need to locate and disable those guns. The Axis have to prevent the loss of this strategic part of Normandy and the artillery guns at all costs.</i> <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md#">Read more</a></td>

## Map Overhauls
These overhauls are primarily intended as visual enhancements. Gameplay changes should only be implemented based on community reports of bugs or possible improvements for competitive play/map balance. For the visual overhauls a few guidelines should be kept in mind. The overall theme of the map _(e.g. winter setting)_ and its atmosphere _(e.g. falling snow)_ should not be altered. Generally, all changes should be as subtle as possible and emphasise on strengthening the original style rather than forcing a different style onto the map.
Basically, what should be aimed for is what CS:GO did to original CS maps. [(Reference)](https://sjackm.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/csgo-first-impressions/)

Local resistance managed to leak information about a secret rocket base to the OSA headquarters. According to the intel, the Axis are developing a new rocket of devastating power. OSA headquarters organised a stealth attack to locate and gain access to said rocket base and steal the prototype.
In the first mission, the Allies launch a stealth attack on an Axis coastal outpost. The Axis forces must retrieve crucial documents depicting the location of the secret rocket base which were left behind in an initial, hasty retreat to a nearby storage facility. 
In the second mission, the Axis fortify their position in the storage facility after successfully retrieving the documents. The Allies must infiltrate the facility, steal the documents and radio the location of the secret Rocket Base to the OSA headquarters.
In the third mission, the Axis attempt to hold the secret rocket base and prevent a loss of the weapon prototype at all cost. The Allies must find the prototype, neutralise and steal it so it can be sent to OSA headquarters for examination.

Axis submarines from a naval base near Bergen, Norway are cause for much distress in the Northern Atlantic. After failed attempts of disabling the base from sea and air, the OSA headquarters decided to send paratroopers behind enemy lines. Their task: Disrupt the supply lines of the base and strike a then vulnerable base from land.
In the first mission, the Axis are preparing a shipment destined for the naval base from a supply depot in the mountains. The Allied paratroopers must seize those supplies for the local resistance to strengthen their efforts against the Axis forces in the region.
In the second mission, alarmed by the loss of the first supply shipment, the Axis attempt to organise retaliation. The Allies must infiltrate the Axis fortification and steal the documents depicting Axis troop movements to disrupt their retaliation attempts.
In the third mission, the Axis attempt to hold their naval base to ensure submarine operations in the Northern Atlantic. The Allies launch their attack on the weakened base and must disable communications to submarines on patrol to enforce their retreat and allow Allied convoys to reach the shores safely.

Game Development

> My involvement with [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy) started around 2013 when I joined the IRC channel and decided to start working on texture replication in HD to get away from the proprietary license. Since then, I have replicated the [world textures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw7Yu-pqzcSaLXEtVEVjZF82UEU) in a 2048x2048 pixel standard, visually overhauled proven community maps and am doing my best for community management as well as reaching out to potential helping hands and sister projects for possible cooperations. Future plans include continuing with map overhauls, restructuring the [wiki](https://dev.etlegacy.com/projects/etlegacy/wiki/index) to make it the first landing page for all questions revolving around ET: Legacy, familiarising myself with 3D modelling to create new playermodels and many more.

Tutorials
============

> I started creating maps for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory back in 2008 and to this day I'm still learning new things about the engine on the regular. Inactive forum boards, dead reference links and a lack of official documentations seem to dominate the current experience when looking for resources. Therefore, I decided to build a tutorial map for new players to learn the game mechanics as well as for new mappers to learn how to build said objectives and what to keep in mind when mapping for ET.
