I'm Cedric *'kemon'* Easton, a Europe-based Level Designer, Environment- and Texture Artist and as of late also a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/realkemon">Twitch streamer</a>. I'm part of the game development team of <a href="https://github.com/etlegacy">ET: Legacy</a>, an open source project aiming to restore the good old days of <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a>. So far, my game development experience mainly revolves around the idtech3 engine environment. However, I have also gained experience in both Unity and Unreal Engine 4 through various tutorial sessions and the Global Game Jams in <a href="https://github.com/realkemon/ggj2020">2020</a> and <a href="https://stefan.ensmann.de/en/among-silhouettes/">2019</a>.

# Level Design

## Own Maps
These are maps that I created from scratch, start to finish. I started my Level Design journey around 2008, when Splash Damage <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/wolfenstein-enemy-territory-map-source-files-released/">released</a> the source files of the 6 standard maps from Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

**Dingenskirchen** *(December, 1944)*

---
*The noose tightens around the Reich's neck as Allied forces threaten to cross the Siegfried Line and invade Germany. An Eifel castle has become a central location for the Kraut High Command in this area to coordinate their troop movements. It is the last obstacle on the road into Germany and one of the final chances for the Axis to ever turn the tables. Not taking any chances, the Allies are attempting to sneak a suitcase bomb into the High Command conference room to disrupt the Axis strategy at its core.*

**Stiglitz** *(July, 1943)*

---
*Local resistance reported a branch of Deathshead’s X-Labs in a small remote village. Hugo Stiglitz, an OSA agent, has been sent to infiltrate the facility and gather intel of Deathshead’s activities. Communication went dead some days ago and Stiglitz' true identity has likely been uncovered, which means almost certain death. The Allies are trying to make their way through the village, free Stiglitz and escort him back to safety for debriefing at the OSA headquarters.*

**Pointe du Hoc** *(June, 1944)*

---
*To grant safe passage for the Allied ships during D-Day a small operation is launched to disable the artillery guns of Pointe du Hoc. The Allies will attempt to gain control of the bunkers on top of the cliff and disable all Axis defense. Expecting a raid at a different section of Normandy, the Axis moved the artillery guns to a railway station in the hinterlands for transport further West. The Allies need to locate and disable those guns. The Axis have to prevent the loss of this strategic part of Normandy and the artillery guns at all costs.*

## Map Overhauls
These overhauls are primarily intended as visual enhancements. Generally, all changes are intended to be as subtle as possible and emphasise on strengthening the original style rather than forcing a different style onto the map. Basically, what was aimed for is what CS:GO did to original CS maps. [(Reference)](https://sjackm.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/csgo-first-impressions/)

### Campaign: Rocket Base
Local resistance managed to leak information about the existence of a secret rocket base to the OSA headquarters. According to the intel, the Axis are developing a new rocket of devastating power, which would turn the tide in the war. OSA organised a stealth attack to gain access and steal the prototype. Unfortunately, the exact location of the rocket base remains yet unknown. Therefore, a strike group of Allied soldiers is sent to a known Axis coastal fortification in the area to gather further intel and do what is necessary to get their hands on the secret rocket prototype.

**Mission 1:** ['Ice, by id software'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_ice.md#)

---
*A small Axis coastal fortress is the target of the Allies strike group sent by OSA. Overwhelmed by the surprise attack, the Axis hastily abandoned the fortress, only to realise that confidential documents were left behind depicting supply routes to the nearby secret rocket base. Under no circumstances do the Axis intend to let the Allies get hold of the new rocket prototype. Hence, the Axis attempt to retrieve the confidential documents left behind in the coastal fortress at all costs, to transmit them to safety.*

**Mission 2:** ['Frostbite, by Moonkey'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_frostbite.md#)

---
*Warned of the Allied plans, the Axis set up position in a fortified storage facility. With the element of surprise lost, the Allies have to launch a direct attack on this storage facility, as it is the only way to get hold of the confidential documents depicting supply routes to the nearby secret rocket base, that so narrowly escaped their grasp last time. Hence, the Allies attempt to infiltrate the facility, steal those documents and radio them to OSA headquarters for decyphering.*

**Mission 3:** ['Missile, by eiM'](https://et.trackbase.net/map/158/) *(planned)*

---
*OSA headquarters managed to decypher the location of the secret rocket base that is said to house a new prototype of devastating power. This weapon is rumoured to turn the tide in the war in favour of whoever holds it. Under no circumstances do the Axis intend to lose the prototype to the Allied attackers and therefore attempt to defend the rocket base. For the Allies the goal is clear: Infiltrate the rocket base and steal the prototype at all cost.*

### Campaign: Submarine Depot
Axis submarines from a naval base near Bergen, Norway are cause for much distress in the Northern Atlantic. After failed attempts of disabling the base from sea and air, the OSA headquarters decided to send paratroopers behind enemy lines. As a direct attack proved fruitless, the ALlies paratroopers are tasked with disrupting the  naval base's supply lines and subsequently strike a then vulnerable base from land. The Axis are attempting to defend their storage facilities to keep a continuous resupply line open to the naval base.

**Mission 1:** ['Supply Depot, by ginc'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_supply.md#)

---
*The first target of the Allied paratroopers tasked with disrupting supply lines of the naval base is a smaller supply depot. According to reports by the local resistance, this depot is currently in the process of preparing a supply shipment. The Allies, therefore, launch an attack to steal this shipment and use it to further strengthen the efforts of the local resistance. The Axis cannot, under any circumstances, allow this shipment to fall into Allied hands and will attempt to defend the depot at all cost.*

**Mission 2:** ['Adlernest, by Dersaidin'](https://et.trackbase.net/map/64/) *(work-in-progress)*

---
*After successfully intercepting the first supply shipment, the Allies continue their attacks with the infiltration of a larger storage facility in the remote mountains. Their attempt is to get their hands on confidential documents that will prove invaluable for future war efforts. The Axis cannot allow this storage facility to be compromised and must defend the documents at all costs.*

**Mission 3:** ['Bergen, by Detoeni'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_bergen.md#)

---
*Having disrupted recent supply shipments, the Allies launch their final attack on the now vulnerable naval base and their goal is clear: Use an armoured vehicle to breach the gates of the base and sabotage the transmitter to disrupt communication to the submarines and force them to retreat. To prevent Allied convoys reaching shores, the Axis have to hold the naval base at all cost and keep the transmitter operational.*

**Revelator** *(Deathmatch map concept)*

---
*This map started as a concept map for a possible Deathmatch gamemode that was intended to be implemented in lua and used on our gameserver ages ago. However, the map quickly evolved into a test ground for experiments regarding lighting, terrain blending, bump mapping and many other 'special' effects in Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.*

**Paragon** *(MOBA map concept)*

---
*[Paragon](https://paragon.fandom.com/wiki/Paragon_Wiki) was a game that I thoroughly enjoyed in the past. It was a fresh take on the MOBA genre and had a very low entry barrier for new players compared to other popular MOBAs. Unfortunately, development and support for this game were stopped around 2018, so I thought I'd give a concept for ET a go. This map is purely conceptual. No attempts at realisation have been done so far.*

*The goal of the created 'R' framework was to investigate which surrounding locality features exist for each charging station in the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) database, make an assumption towards the location category* (e.g. in residential areas, rest stop along motorways, etc.)*, investigate how each location category evolves over the years and compare that evolution with the timeframe of state subsidies.*
