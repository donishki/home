==========

I'm Cedric a.k.a. kemon, a Europe-based Level Designer, Environment- and Texture Artist and as of late also a [Twitch streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/realkemon). I'm part of the game development team of [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy), an open source project aiming to restore the good old days of [Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory](https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory). So far my game development experience mainly revolves around to the idtech3 engine environment. However, I have also gained experience in both Unity and Unreal Engine 4 through various tutorial sessions and the Global Game Jams in [2020](https://github.com/realkemon/ggj2020) and [2019](https://stefan.ensmann.de/en/among-silhouettes/).

Game Development
============

> My involvement with [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy) started around 2013 when I joined the IRC channel and decided to start working on texture replication in HD to get away from the proprietary license. Since then, I have replicated the [world textures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw7Yu-pqzcSaLXEtVEVjZF82UEU) in a 2048x2048 pixel standard, visually overhauled proven community maps and am doing my best for community management as well as reaching out to potential helping hands and sister projects for possible cooperations. Future plans include continuing with map overhauls, restructuring the [wiki](https://dev.etlegacy.com/projects/etlegacy/wiki/index) to make it the first landing page for all questions revolving around ET: Legacy, familiarising myself with 3D modelling to create new playermodels and many more.

Level Design
============

> There are two sides to my work as a Level Designer. The first one being **own projects** that I created from scratch, start to finish. So far these are [Dingenskirchen](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/dingenskirchen.md), [Stiglitz](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/stiglitz.md) and [Pointe du Hoc](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/pointe_du_hoc.md). The second aspect of my efforts are **map overhauls** for [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etlegacy.md). These are include ['Frostbite, by Moonkey'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_frostbite.md), ['Bergen, by Detoeni'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_bergen.md), ['Ice, by id software'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_ice.md) and ['Supply Depot, by ginc'](https://github.com/realkemon/home/blob/master/pages/etl_ice.md).

Tutorials
============

> I started creating maps for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory back in 2008 and to this day I'm still learning new things about the engine on the regular. Inactive forum boards, dead reference links and a lack of official documentations seem to dominate the current experience when looking for resources. Therefore, I decided to build a tutorial map for new players to learn the game mechanics as well as for new mappers to learn how to build said objectives and what to keep in mind when mapping for ET.
