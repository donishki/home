# Cedric *'kemon'* Easton
I'm a Europe-based professional Data Scientist and hobby Game Developer, primarily involved in community projects surrounding the old-school titles <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory">**Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory**</a> and <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/RTCW-MP">**Return to Castle Wolfenstein**</a> in the idTech 3 engine environment. My primary activity in that regard is my commitment as an Level Designer and Community Manager to [**ET: Legacy**](https://github.com/etlegacy), an open source project aiming to restore the good old days of **Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory** - whose gameplay is still considered unmatched by many, despite its great age. However, with a rather small, but surprisingly dedicated community surrounding both titles, the ties to other related community projects are very strong.

Their attempt is to get their hands on confidential documents that will prove invaluable for future war efforts. The Axis cannot allow this storage facility to be compromised and must defend the documents at all costs.</i>

To prevent Allied convoys reaching shores, the Axis have to hold the naval base at all cost and keep the transmitter operational.</i>

**Level Design tutorials** *(Using Garux' NetRadiant)*

*These days, unforunately, a lot of documentations and tutorial pages for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory have gone offline. This raises the entry barrier for new mappers so I decided to start a tutorial series. It is intended to explain engine quirks, performance metrics, entity setups and good practises. This remains a heavy work in progress.*

*Influence of state subsidies and local conditions on the development of public EV charging infrastructure within Europe.*

---
*The goal of the created 'R' framework was to investigate which surrounding locality features exist for each charging station in the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) database, make an assumption towards the location category* (e.g. in residential areas, rest stop along motorways, etc.)*, investigate how each location category evolves over the years and compare that evolution with the timeframe of state subsidies.*
