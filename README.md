INTRODUCTION
============

Hello there. I'm Cedric a.k.a. kemon, a Europe-based Level Designer, Environment- and 2D Artist as well as a Twitch streamer. I'm part of the game development team of [ET: Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy), an open source project aiming to restore the good old days of [Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory](https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory). So far my game development experience mainly revolves around to the idtech3 engine environment. However, I have also gained experience in both Unity and Unreal Engine 4. In 2019 I participated in a [Game Jam](https://stefan.ensmann.de/en/among-silhouettes/) using the Unity Engine.


Twitch
============

My motivation to create a [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/realkemon) was mainly influenced by [simonoc](http://simonoc.com/) who is a very talented level designer in the quake engine environment and a huge personal inspiration for me. I started my Twitch channel in September 2019 and have streamed the development progress of Pointe du Hoc, my submission for the 2019 Trackbase map contest. 
If you are interested in my work then I would love to welcome you to my [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/realkemon) at some time. Content will range from personal Level Design projects, over ET: Legacy related development efforts to occasionally game streams.


Level Design
============

There are two sides to my work as a Level Designer. The first one being own projects that I created from scratch start to finish. So far these include Dingenskirchen, Stiglitz and Pointe du Hoc. The latter two having been created as part of the annual [Trackbase map contests](https://contest.trackbase.net/).
The second aspect to my efforts are map overhauls for ET: Legacy. These overhauls are mainly intended as visual enhancements to bring maps with proven gameplay to more modern visual standards. The only exception for gameplay changes are reports by the majority of the competitive player community regarding bugs or possible enhancements to gameplay.

**Guidelines**

As part of the visual enhancement of ET: Legacy, a new renderer is being developed. For it to take full effect on maps, a recompile is very helpful. Because of that, several maps, which all are community favourites, have been selected and overhauled in preparation of the new renderer. These overhauls are intended as purely visual enhancements. Gameplay changes should only be implemented based on community reports about bugs or possible improvements for competitive play/map balance. For the visual overhauls a few guidelines should be kept in mind. The overall theme of the map *(e.g. winter setting)* and its atmosphere *(e.g. falling snow)* should not be altered. Generally, all changes should be as subtle as possible and emphasise on strengthening the original style rather than forcing a different style onto the map.

Basically, what should be aimed for is what CS:GO did to original CS maps. [(Reference)](https://sjackm.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/csgo-first-impressions/)
