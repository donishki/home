Story
============

In an attempt to locate the X-Labs run by Deathshead in occupied Norway, the Allies have set up a position close to an Axis Outpost.
Facing the Allied advances, the Axis quickly retreated and abandoned the coastal fortress leaving behind crucial documents depicting Axis troop movement and strongholds. 
The Axis forces must get hold of the documents left behind in the quickly abandoned fortress and radio them to the headquarters for safe-keeping. 
The Allies attempt to hold the fortress until further reinforcements can make their way to the location.
